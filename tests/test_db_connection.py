"""Tests for the sqlite-vec availability probe and loader in ``db.connection``.

The probe must answer "importable *and* loadable", not just "importable": a
pyenv / system Python whose bundled SQLite was built without extension loading
can still ``import sqlite_vec`` while every connection then raises
``AttributeError: 'sqlite3.Connection' object has no attribute
'enable_load_extension'``. Treating that as available made the viewer log a
traceback on every async request instead of using the NumPy search fallback.
