    Per-path rather than per-count, unlike ``CullApplyResponse``: the request
    can mix visible and invisible paths, and ordinary frames with refused
    bracket leads, in one call, and the gallery's bulk surface needs to know
    WHICH path landed in which bucket to report a partial result ("3 deleted,
    1 refused") rather than an all-or-nothing outcome. ``sequence_siblings``
    is the one field kept per-path rather than per-count even though
    ``CullApplyResponse`` reports the same thing as a count: it is populated
    the same way -- every frame ``include_sequence_siblings`` pulled in by
    sharing a requested path's ``(sequence_kind, sequence_group_id)`` -- but
    named here so the caller can tell WHICH frames were added, matching this
    response's own per-path idiom.

    A trashed ``include_companions`` RAW/``.xmp`` that is itself a separate
    ``photos`` row is folded into ``deleted``, not a distinct bucket -- its
    file is gone the moment the trash succeeds, so it is exactly as deleted
    as any path the caller named directly. ``skipped`` mirrors
    ``CullApplyResponse``'s field of the same name: a path that was visible,
    in ``photos``, and not a refused bracket lead, but whose file could not
    be resolved on disk (already missing) -- landing in no other bucket.
